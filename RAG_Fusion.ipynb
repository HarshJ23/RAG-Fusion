              "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.paulgraham.com/start.html', 'title': 'How to Start a Startup', 'language': 'No language found.'}, page_content='How to Start a Startup\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\\nY Combinator.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarch 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer\\nSociety.)You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with\\ngood people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend\\nas little money as possible.  Most startups that fail do it because\\nthey fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three will\\nprobably succeed.And that\\'s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all\\nthree are doable.  Hard, but doable.  And since a startup that\\nsucceeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting\\nrich is doable too.  Hard, but doable.If there is one message I\\'d like to get across about startups,\\nthat\\'s it.  There is no magically difficult step that requires\\nbrilliance to solve.The IdeaIn particular, you don\\'t need a brilliant \\nidea to start a startup\\naround.   The way a startup makes money is to offer people better\\ntechnology than they have now.  But what people have now is often\\nso bad that it doesn\\'t take brilliance to do better.Google\\'s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that\\ndidn\\'t suck.  They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use\\nlinks to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with\\nunintrusive keyword-based ads.  Above all, they were determined to\\nmake a site that was good to use.  No doubt there are great technical\\ntricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward.\\nAnd while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings\\nthem a billion dollars a year. [1]There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search\\nwas before Google.  I can think of several heuristics for generating\\nideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something\\npeople are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that\\ndoesn\\'t suck.For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did\\nbefore Google.  They all use the same simple-minded model.\\nThey seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to\\ndo database matches instead of how dating works in the real world.\\nAn undergrad could build something better as a class project.  And\\nyet there\\'s a lot of money at stake.  Online dating is a valuable\\nbusiness now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it\\nworked.An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.  A lot of\\nwould-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the\\ninitial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute.\\nVenture capitalists know better.  If you go to VC firms with a\\nbrilliant idea that you\\'ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure\\nagreement, most will tell you to get lost.   That shows how much a \\nmere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience \\nof signing an NDA.Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number\\nof startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft\\'s original\\nplan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things.\\nTheir current business model didn\\'t occur to them until IBM dropped\\nit in their lap five years later.Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble\\nis, they\\'re not transferrable.  They\\'re not something you could\\nhand to someone else to execute.  Their value is mainly as starting\\npoints: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking\\nabout.What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them.  Good\\npeople can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can\\'t save bad people.  \\nPeopleWhat do I mean by good people?  One of the best tricks I learned   \\nduring our startup was a rule for deciding \\nwho to hire.  Could you\\ndescribe the person as an animal?  It might be hard to translate   \\nthat into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows  \\nwhat it means.  It means someone who takes their work a little too   \\nseriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass\\nright through professional and cross over into obsessive.What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who\\njust won\\'t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till   \\n4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR   \\nperson who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell\\nphones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something \\nis two millimeters out of place.Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. \\nThe woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel\\nsorry for potential customers on the phone with her.  You could  \\nsense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no  \\nrest for them till they\\'d signed up.If you think about people you know, you\\'ll find the animal test is\\neasy to apply.  Call the person\\'s image to mind and imagine the\\nsentence \"so-and-so is an animal.\"  If you laugh, they\\'re not.  You\\ndon\\'t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but\\nyou need it in a startup.For programmers we had three additional tests.  Was the person\\ngenuinely smart?  If so, could they actually get things done?  And\\nfinally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities,   \\ncould we stand to have them around?That last test filters out surprisingly few people.  We could bear\\nany amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.  What we couldn\\'t\\nstand were people with a lot of attitude.  But most of those weren\\'t\\ntruly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the\\nfirst.When nerds are unbearable it\\'s usually because they\\'re trying too\\nhard to seem smart.  But the smarter they are, the less pressure\\nthey feel to act smart.  So as a rule you can recognize genuinely\\nsmart people by their ability to say things like \"I don\\'t know,\"   \\n\"Maybe you\\'re right,\" and \"I don\\'t understand x well enough.\"This technique doesn\\'t always work, because people can be influenced\\nby their environment.  In the MIT CS department, there seems to be\\na tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I\\'m told it derives\\nultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline\\npilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.  Even genuinely\\nsmart people start to act this way there, so you have to make\\nallowances.It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to\\nsay \"I don\\'t know\" of anyone I\\'ve met.  (At least, he was before he \\nbecame a professor at MIT.)  No one dared put on attitude around   \\nRobert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had\\nzero attitude himself.Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was\\nthrough personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired.\\nThis is a crucial difference between startups and big companies.\\nBeing friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you \\nmore than companies could ever learn in interviews.  [2]It\\'s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because\\nthat\\'s where smart people meet.  It\\'s not what people learn in    \\nclasses at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies\\nspring up around them.  They could sing campfire songs in the classes\\nso long as admissions worked the same.If you start a startup, there\\'s a good chance it will be with people\\nyou know from college or grad school.  So in theory you ought to  \\ntry to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school,\\nright?  Well, no.  Don\\'t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that\\ndoesn\\'t work well with hackers.What you should do in college is work on your own projects.  Hackers\\nshould do this even if they don\\'t plan to start startups, because \\nit\\'s the only real way to learn how to program.   In some cases you\\nmay collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to\\nget to know good hackers.  The project may even grow into a startup.\\nBut once again, I wouldn\\'t aim too directly at either target.  Don\\'t\\nforce things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.Ideally you want between two and four founders.  It would be hard\\nto start with just one.  One person would find the moral weight of\\nstarting a company hard to bear.  Even Bill Gates, who seems to be   \\nable to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. \\nBut you don\\'t want so many founders that the company starts to look\\nlike a group photo.  Partly because you don\\'t need a lot of people\\nat first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse\\ndisagreements you\\'ll have. When there are just two or three founders,\\nyou know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.  If\\nthere are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into\\nfactions.  You don\\'t want mere voting; you need unanimity.In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders\\nshould include technical people.   During the Internet Bubble there \\nwere a number of startups founded by business people who then went\\nlooking for hackers to create their product for them.  This doesn\\'t  \\nwork well.  Business people are bad at deciding what to do with   \\ntechnology, because they don\\'t know what the options are, or which\\nkinds of problems are hard and which are easy.  And when business\\npeople try to hire hackers, they can\\'t tell which ones are \\ngood.\\nEven other hackers have a hard time doing that. \\nFor business people it\\'s roulette.Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?  That\\ndepends.  We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several \\npeople who were said to know about this mysterious thing called\\n\"business\" if they would be the president.  But they all said no,\\nso I had to do it myself.  And what I discovered was that business\\nwas no great mystery.   It\\'s not something like physics or medicine\\nthat requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to pay\\nyou for stuff.I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was\\ndisgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,   \\nintellectual world of software, not deal with customers\\' mundane  \\nproblems.  People who don\\'t want to get dragged into some kind of\\nwork often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos was\\nparticularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit\\nin half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other\\npeople to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for\\nmath.  Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same  \\ntrick to some degree.Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found\\nthat business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.  There\\nare esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law\\nor the pricing of derivatives, but you don\\'t need to know about   \\nthose in a startup.  All you need to know about business to run a  \\nstartup are commonsense things people knew before there were business\\nschools, or even universities.If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the   \\nname of each person with an MBA, you\\'ll learn something important\\nabout business school.  After Warren Buffett, you don\\'t hit another \\nMBA till number 22,\\nPhil Knight, the CEO of Nike.  There are only 5 MBAs in the top\\n50.  What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with      \\ntechnical backgrounds.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,\\nMichael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.  The rulers of the technology\\nbusiness tend to come from technology, not business.  So if you   \\nwant to invest two years in something that will help you succeed  \\nin business, the evidence suggests you\\'d do better to learn how to   \\nhack than get an MBA. [3]There is one reason you might want to include business people in a\\nstartup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing\\nand able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business\\npeople can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not   \\ndesign it.  That\\'s nonsense.  There\\'s nothing about knowing how to\\nprogram that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about\\nnot knowing how to program that magically enables business people \\nto understand them.If you can\\'t understand users, however, you should either learn how\\nor find a co-founder who can.  That is the single most important\\nissue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them\\nthan anything else.What Customers WantIt\\'s not just startups that have to worry about this.  I think most\\nbusinesses that fail do it because they don\\'t give customers what\\nthey want.  Look at restaurants.  A large percentage fail, about a\\nquarter in the first year.  But can you think of one restaurant\\nthat had really good food and went out of business?Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.  A    \\nrestaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy,\\nout of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep\\ncoming.  It\\'s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes \\nattract customers through gimmicks.  But that approach is very  \\nrisky.  It\\'s more straightforward just to make the food good.It\\'s the same with technology.  You hear all kinds of reasons why\\nstartups fail.  But can you think of one that had a massively popular\\nproduct and still failed?In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers\\ndidn\\'t want the product.  For most, the cause of death is listed  \\nas \"ran out of funding,\" but that\\'s only the immediate cause.  Why \\ncouldn\\'t they get more funding?  Probably because the product was\\na dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to   \\ndo, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you\\ncan.  But I decided not to, because that\\'s implicit in making\\nsomething customers want.  The only way to make something customers\\nwant is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on   \\ntheir reactions.The other approach is what I call the \"Hail Mary\" strategy.  You  \\nmake elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to   \\ndevelop it (people who do this tend to use the term \"engineer\" for   \\nhackers), and then find after a year that you\\'ve spent two million\\ndollars to develop something no one wants.  This was not uncommon\\nduring the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, \\nwho thought of software development as something terrifying that\\ntherefore had to be carefully planned.We never even considered that approach.  As a Lisp hacker, I come \\nfrom the tradition of rapid prototyping.  I would not claim (at\\nleast, not here) that this is the right way to write every program,\\nbut it\\'s certainly the right way to write software for a startup.\\nIn a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in\\nsome way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.   \\nThe only way to do that is to try implementing them.Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.  At first we\\nexpected our customers to be Web consultants.  But it turned out\\nthey didn\\'t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted\\nthe site.  It would be too easy for clients to fire them.  We also\\nthought we\\'d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because\\nselling online was a natural extension of their existing business.\\nBut in 1996 that was a hard sell.  The middle managers we talked   \\nto at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as\\nsomething that meant more work for them.We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.  Among\\nthem was Frederick\\'s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience\\ndealing with heavy loads on our servers.  But most of our users   \\nwere small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity \\nto build a business.  Some had retail stores, but many only existed\\nonline.  And so we changed direction to focus on these users.\\nInstead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog\\ncompanies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.I learned something valuable from that.  It\\'s worth trying very, \\nvery hard to make technology easy to use.  Hackers are so used to\\ncomputers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to\\nnormal people.  Stephen Hawking\\'s editor told him that every equation\\nhe included in his book would cut sales in half.  When you work on\\nmaking technology easier to use, you\\'re riding that curve up instead  \\nof down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn\\'t just increase    \\nyour sales 10%.  It\\'s more likely to double your sales.How do you figure out what customers want?  Watch them.  One of the\\nbest places to do this was at trade shows.  Trade shows didn\\'t pay \\nas a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market\\nresearch.  We didn\\'t just give canned presentations at trade shows.\\nWe used to show people how to build real, working stores.  Which   \\nmeant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them    \\nabout what they needed.No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a   \\nstretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.  The\\nonly kind of software you can build without studying users is the    \\nsort for which you are the typical user.  But this is just the kind\\nthat tends to be open source: operating systems, programming\\nlanguages, editors, and so on.  So if you\\'re developing technology\\nfor money, you\\'re probably not going to be developing it for people\\nlike you.  Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for\\nstartups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?When most people think of startups, they think of companies like\\nApple or Google.  Everyone knows these, because they\\'re big consumer\\nbrands.  But for every startup like that, there are twenty more  \\nthat operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure.\\nSo if you start a successful startup, odds are you\\'ll start one of \\nthose.Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup\\nthat has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding\\nare steeper.  The best odds are in niche markets.  Since startups  \\nmake money by offering people something better than they had before,\\nthe best opportunities are where things suck most.  And it would   \\nbe hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate  \\nIT departments.  You would not believe the amount of money companies\\nspend on software, and the crap they get in return.  This imbalance\\nequals opportunity.If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you\\ncould do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a  \\ncouple weeks just watching what they do with computers.  Most good\\nhackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places\\nthan rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it\\'s easier\\nto sell to them.  It\\'s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies\\nthat the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a\\nlot of time and money to do it.  And while you can outhack Oracle\\nwith one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can\\'t outsell an\\nOracle salesman.  So if you want to win through better technology,\\naim at smaller customers.  [4]They\\'re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.    \\nIn technology, the low end always eats the high end.  It\\'s easier  \\nto make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful\\nproduct cheaper.  So the products that start as cheap, simple options\\ntend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a  \\nroom, they squash the \"high-end\" products against the ceiling.  Sun\\ndid this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.  Microsoft\\nWord did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and\\nFramemaker.  Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive\\nmodels made for professionals.  Avid did it to the manufacturers     \\nof specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to\\nAvid.  Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded\\nhim.  If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you\\'ll not only\\nfind it easier to sell at first, but you\\'ll also be in the best   \\nposition to conquer the rest of the market.It\\'s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.  If you have the\\ncheapest, easiest product, you\\'ll own the low end.  And if you\\ndon\\'t, you\\'re in the crosshairs of whoever does.Raising MoneyTo make all this happen, you\\'re going to need money.  Some startups\\nhave been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren\\'t.\\nI think it\\'s wise to take money from investors.  To be self-funding,\\nyou have to start as a consulting company, and it\\'s hard to switch\\nfrom that to a product company.Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.  The way to get\\nrich from a startup is to maximize the company\\'s chances of succeeding,\\nnot to maximize the amount of stock you retain.  So if you can trade\\nstock for something that improves your odds, it\\'s probably a smart \\nmove.To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and\\nmysterious process.  Actually it\\'s merely tedious.  I\\'ll try to\\ngive an outline of how it works.The first thing you\\'ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars   \\nto pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.  This is called\\nseed capital.  Because so little money is involved, raising seed\\ncapital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a\\nquick yes or no.Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called\\n\"angels.\" Often they\\'re people who themselves got rich from technology.\\nAt the seed stage, investors don\\'t expect you to have an elaborate\\nbusiness plan.  Most know that they\\'re supposed to decide quickly.\\nIt\\'s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page\\nagreement.We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian.\\nBut he gave us a lot more than money.  He\\'s a former CEO and also\\na corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about\\nbusiness, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as\\na company.  Plus he introduced us to one of the two \\nangel investors who supplied our next round of funding.Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be     \\nsatisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to \\ndo.  But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to\\nremind themselves what they invested in.Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I\\'m amazed how much\\nworry it caused me.  \"Business plan\" has that word \"business\" in\\nit, so I figured it had to be something I\\'d have to read a book\\nabout business plans to write.  Well, it doesn\\'t.  At this stage,\\nall most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan    \\nto do and how you\\'re going to make money from it, and the resumes \\nof the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you\\'ve\\nbeen saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn\\'t take\\nmore than a couple hours, and you\\'ll probably find that writing it\\nall down gives you more ideas about what to do.For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you\\'re going\\nto have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselves\\nisn\\'t hard.  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to\\ndecide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  If\\nthere are two founders with the same qualifications who are both\\nequally committed to the business, that\\'s easy.  But if you have a\\nnumber of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees,\\narranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you\\'ve\\ndone it, it tends to be set in stone.I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is,\\ntry hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing\\nwhen you have, though.  When everyone feels they\\'re getting a\\nslightly bad deal, that they\\'re doing more than they should for the\\namount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of\\ncourse: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation,    \\nvarious things with the IRS.  I\\'m not even sure what the list is,\\nbecause we, ah, skipped all that.  When we got real funding near\\nthe end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything   \\nretroactively.  It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if\\nyou don\\'t do everything you\\'re supposed to when starting a company.\\nAnd a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started.\\n[5]It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because\\none or more of the founders might decide to split off and start   \\nanother company doing the same thing.  This does happen.  So when\\nyou set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you\\nshould get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone\\'s\\nideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be\\neveryone\\'s only job.[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]While you\\'re at it, you should ask what else they\\'ve signed.  One\\nof the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into       \\nintellectual property problems.  We did, and it came closer to \\nkilling us than any competitor ever did.As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one\\nof our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said\\nall his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him\\nto go to grad school.  In theory, that could have meant someone\\nelse owned big chunks of our software.  So the acquisition came to\\na screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.  The problem      \\nwas, since we\\'d been about to be acquired, we\\'d allowed ourselves \\nto run low on cash.  Now we needed to raise more to keep going. \\nBut it\\'s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because\\ninvestors can\\'t judge how serious it is.Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere\\nelse to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I\\nwill not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word   \\n\"angel\" is a metaphor.  The founders thereupon proposed to walk   \\naway from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial \\non how to administer the servers themselves.  And while this was\\nhappening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on  \\nthe deal.Miraculously it all turned out ok.  The investors backed down; we\\ndid another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant\\ncompany finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn\\'t own our\\nsoftware; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much\\nmore than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.  So we were happy\\nin the end, though the experience probably took several years off  \\nmy life.Don\\'t do what we did.  Before you consummate a startup, ask \\neveryone about their previous IP history.Once you\\'ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go\\nknocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens\\nof thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch \\nof guys with some ideas.  But when you look at it from the rich\\npeople\\'s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich \\npeople are looking for good investments.  If you really think you\\nhave a chance of succeeding, you\\'re doing them a favor by letting\\nthem invest.  Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being   \\napproached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.  They get \\nthe same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future\\nrounds.  How much stock should they get?  That depends on how\\nambitious you feel.  When you offer x percent of your company for\\ny dollars, you\\'re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole\\ncompany.  Venture investments are usually described in terms of\\nthat number.  If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of\\nthose already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you\\'ve done\\nthe deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.How do you decide what the value of the company should be?  There\\nis no rational way.  At this stage the company is just a bet.  I\\ndidn\\'t realize that when we were raising money.  Julian\\nthought we ought to value the company at several million \\ndollars.  I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple\\nthousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth\\nseveral million dollars.  Eventually we settled on one million,\\nbecause Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation\\nany lower. [6]What I didn\\'t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn\\'t just   \\nthe value of the code we\\'d written so far.  It was also the value\\nof our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future\\nwork we\\'d do, which turned out to be a lot.The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with \\nactual \\nventure capital firms.  \\nBut don\\'t wait till you\\'ve burned   \\nthrough your last round of funding to start approaching them.  VCs are slow to\\nmake up their minds.  They can take months.  You don\\'t want to be \\nrunning out of money while you\\'re trying to negotiate with them.Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting\\nmoney from angels.  The amounts of money involved are larger, millions\\nusually.  So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose\\nmore onerous conditions.Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. \\nUsually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced,\\nwith a business background.  Maybe in some cases this is true.   And\\nyet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business \\nbackground, and he seems to have done ok.  Steve Jobs got booted\\nout of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a\\nbusiness background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.  So I\\nthink people who are mature and experienced, with a business\\nbackground, may be overrated.  We used to call these guys \"newscasters,\"\\nbecause they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and\\ngenerally didn\\'t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing\\nour startup entirely with angel money.  The main reason was that     \\nwe feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as\\npart of the deal.  That might have been ok if he was content to\\nlimit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to  \\nhave a say in running the company?   That would have led to disaster,\\nbecause our software was so complex.  We were a company whose whole\\nm.o. was to win through better technology.  The strategic decisions\\nwere mostly decisions about technology, and we didn\\'t need any help\\nwith those.This was also one reason we didn\\'t go public.  Back in 1998 our CFO\\ntried to talk me into it.  In those days you could go public as a\\ndogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues,\\nwe might have done well.  But I feared it would have meant taking\\non a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, \"can talk Wall Street\\'s\\nlanguage.\"I\\'m happy to see Google is bucking that trend.  They didn\\'t talk\\nWall Street\\'s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street\\ndidn\\'t buy.  And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself.\\nThey\\'ll pay attention next time.  Wall Street learns new languages   \\nfast when money is involved.You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.  The   \\nreason is other VCs.  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk\\nto them you realize that it\\'s a seller\\'s market.  Even now there\\nis too much money chasing too few good deals.VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and\\nKleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you\\'ve never \\nheard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them \\nis worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don\\'t just \\nprovide money, but connections and advice.  If you\\'re talking to  \\nVinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But such\\nadvice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go down\\nthe food chain the VCs get rapidly \\n\\ndumber.  A few steps down from \\nthe top you\\'re basically talking to bankers who\\'ve picked up a few\\nnew vocabulary words from reading Wired.  (Does your product\\nuse XML?)  So I\\'d advise you to be skeptical about claims\\nof experience and connections.  Basically, a VC is a source of\\nmoney.  I\\'d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money  \\nthe soonest with the least strings attached.You may wonder how much to tell VCs.  And you should, because some\\nof them may one day be funding your competitors.  I think the best\\nplan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything\\neither.  After all, as most VCs say, they\\'re more interested in the\\npeople than the ideas.  The main reason they want to talk about\\nyour idea is to judge you, not the idea.  So as long as you seem\\nlike you know what you\\'re doing, you can probably keep a few things\\nback from them. [7]Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don\\'t want their money,\\nbecause a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you,     \\nand b) if you seem impressive, they\\'ll be discouraged from investing\\nin your competitors.  The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially\\nif you only want them to know about you and don\\'t want their money,\\nis at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups   \\nto present to them.Not Spending ItWhen and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what\\nshould you do with it?  Not spend it, that\\'s what.  In nearly every   \\nstartup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. \\nUsually there is something deeper wrong.  But even a proximate cause\\nof death is worth trying hard to avoid.During the Bubble many startups tried to \"get big fast.\" Ideally\\nthis meant getting a lot of customers fast.  But it was easy for\\nthe meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast\\nis of course preferable.  But even that may be overrated.  The idea\\nis to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for\\ncompetitors.  But I think in most businesses the advantages of being\\nfirst to market are not so overwhelmingly great.  Google is again\\na case in point.  When they appeared it seemed as if search was a\\nmature market, dominated by big players who\\'d spent millions to\\nbuild their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista,  \\nInktomi.  Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing\\nin the search business.  You can come along at any point and make \\nsomething better, and users will gradually seep over to you.  As  \\nif to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.  They\\'re\\nlike dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use\\nit themselves.The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those\\nmillions improving their software.  Future startups should learn\\nfrom that mistake.  Unless you\\'re in a market where products are   \\nas undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent,\\nspending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.  And few\\nif any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.  The dating sites  \\nare running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the \\nmore evidence they\\'re ripe for the picking.  (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I  \\nsmell a company run by marketing guys.)We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect\\nit was a good thing.  The founders all learned to do every job in  \\nthe company.  As well as writing software, I had to do sales and\\ncustomer support.  At sales I was not very good.  I was persistent,\\nbut I didn\\'t have the smoothness of a good salesman.  My message   \\nto potential customers was: you\\'d be stupid not to sell online, and  \\nif you sell online you\\'d be stupid to use anyone else\\'s software.   \\nBoth statements were true, but that\\'s not the way to convince people.I was great at customer support though.  Imagine talking to a\\ncustomer support person who not only knew everything about the\\nproduct, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then\\nfix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.  Customers\\nloved us.  And we loved them, because when you\\'re growing slow by\\nword of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart\\nenough to find you by themselves.  There is nothing more valuable,\\nin the early stages of a startup, than smart users.  If you listen\\nto them, they\\'ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.      \\nAnd not only will they give you this advice for free, they\\'ll pay\\nyou.We officially launched in early 1996.  By the end of that year we\\nhad about 70 users.  Since this was the era of \"get big fast,\" I\\nworried about how small and obscure we were.  But in fact we were\\ndoing exactly the right thing.  Once you get big (in users or\\nemployees) it gets hard to change your product.  That year was\\neffectively a laboratory for improving our software.  By the end  \\nof it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had \\na hope of catching up.  And since all the hackers had spent many\\nhours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better\\nthan anyone else.That\\'s the key to success as a startup.  There is nothing more \\nimportant than understanding your business.  You might think that\\nanyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.  Far from it.   \\nGoogle\\'s secret\\nweapon was simply that they understood search.  I was working for \\nYahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn\\'t understand search.  I\\nknow because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we\\nhad to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the\\nparty line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere \"search engine.\"\\nSearch was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than\\none month\\'s growth, and now that we were established as a \"media   \\ncompany,\" or \"portal,\" or whatever we were, search could safely be\\nallowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an  \\nimportant fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions  \\nstart with.  I think Yahoo gets that now.Google understands a few other things most Web companies still\\ndon\\'t.  The most important is that you should put users before\\nadvertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren\\'t.\\nOne of my favorite bumper stickers reads \"if the people lead, the  \\nleaders will follow.\" Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes \"get\\nall the users, and the advertisers will follow.\"  More generally,\\ndesign your product to please users first, and then think about how\\nto make money from it.  If you don\\'t put users first, you leave a    \\ngap for competitors who do.To make something users love, you have to understand them.  And the\\nbigger you are, the harder that is.  So I say \"get big slow.\" The\\nslower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to\\nlearn.The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture \\nof cheapness.  That\\'s something Yahoo did understand.  David Filo\\'s \\ntitle was \"Chief Yahoo,\" but he was proud that his unofficial title\\nwas \"Cheap Yahoo.\"  Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email\\nfrom Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy,      \\nasking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on\\nexpensive RAID drives.  I was impressed by that.  Yahoo\\'s market\\ncap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying\\nabout wasting a few gigs of disk space.When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to\\nfeel rich.  It\\'s important to realize you\\'re not.  A rich company\\nis one with large revenues.  This money isn\\'t revenue.  It\\'s money\\ninvestors have given you in the hope you\\'ll be able to generate   \\nrevenues.  So despite those millions in the bank, you\\'re still poor.For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm.\\nAim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.  For us the\\ntest of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron\\nchairs.  The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular\\nwith startups.  Especially the type, all too common then, that was\\nlike a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.   We   \\nhad office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.  This was \\nslightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty\\natmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right \\nwithout knowing it.Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.  It\\nhad been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a   \\nclaw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.  It must once have been inhabited\\nby someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the    \\nwalls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against   \\ncosmic rays.  When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit\\nsheepish about the low production values.  But in fact that place\\nwas the perfect space for a startup.  We felt like our role was to \\nbe impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that    \\nis exactly the spirit you want.An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software.\\nCube farms suck for that, as you\\'ve probably discovered if you\\'ve\\ntried it.  Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than\\nat work?  So why not make work more like home?When you\\'re looking for space for a startup, don\\'t feel that it has\\nto look professional.  Professional means doing good work, not\\nelevators and glass walls.  I\\'d advise most startups to avoid\\ncorporate space at first and just rent an apartment.  You want to\\nlive at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed\\nto be lived in as your office?Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be\\nin better locations than office buildings.  And for a startup\\nlocation is very important.  The key to productivity is for people\\nto come back to work after dinner.  Those hours after the phone\\nstops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.  Great\\nthings happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, \\ntalk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement  \\nthem.  So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of\\nrestaurants around, not some dreary office park that\\'s a wasteland\\nafter 6:00 PM.  Once a company shifts over into the model where \\neveryone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you\\'ve\\nlost something extraordinarily valuable.  God help you if you\\nactually start in that mode.If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three   \\nplaces I\\'d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard,\\nor Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University\\nor California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of   \\ncampus.  These are the only places I know that have the right kind\\nof vibe.The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.  \\nI may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing\\na company can do.  To start with, people are a recurring expense, \\nwhich is the worst kind.  They also tend to cause you to grow out     \\nof your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office\\nbuilding that will make your software worse.  But worst of all,\\nthey slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone\\'s    \\noffice and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to\\nhave a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, the\\nbetter.During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  They\\nwanted to get \"staffed up\" as soon as possible, as if you couldn\\'t \\nget anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding \\njob title.  That\\'s big company thinking.  Don\\'t hire people to fill\\nthe gaps in some a priori org chart.  The only reason to hire someone\\nis to do something you\\'d like to do but can\\'t.If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why\\ndo nearly all companies do it?  I think the main reason is that\\npeople like the idea of having a lot of people working for them.\\nThis weakness often extends right up to the CEO.  If you ever end\\nup running a company, you\\'ll find the most common question people\\nask is how many employees you have.  This is their way of weighing\\nyou.  It\\'s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do.\\nAnd they\\'re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a\\nthousand than if it\\'s ten.This is ridiculous, really.  If two companies have the same revenues,\\nit\\'s the one with fewer employees that\\'s more impressive.  When  \\npeople used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered\\n\"twenty,\" I could see them thinking that we didn\\'t count for much.\\nI used to want to add \"but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly\\nkick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger\\nof the two numbers?\"As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice \\nbetween seeming impressive, and being impressive.  Any of you who  \\nwere nerds in high school know about this \\nchoice.  Keep doing it when you start a company.Should You?But should you start a company?  Are you the right sort of person\\nto do it?  If you are, is it worth it?More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than\\nrealize it.  That\\'s the main reason I wrote this.  There could be   \\nten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be\\na good thing.I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a   \\nstartup.  But the idea terrified me at first.  I was forced into   \\nit because I was a Lisp hacker.  The company\\nI\\'d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there  \\nwere not a lot of other companies using Lisp.  Since I couldn\\'t  \\nbear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995,\\nremember, when \"another language\" meant C++) the only option seemed\\nto be to start a new company using Lisp.I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you\\'re a Lisp hacker\\nyou\\'ll know what I mean.  And if the idea of starting a startup\\nfrightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there  \\nmust be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too    \\nintimidated to try.So who should start a startup?  Someone who is a good hacker, between\\nabout 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one\\nshot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working\\nlife.I can\\'t say precisely what a good hacker is.  At a first rate   \\nuniversity this might include the top half of computer science   \\nmajors.  Though of course you don\\'t have to be a CS major to be a\\nhacker; I was a philosophy major in college.It\\'s hard to tell whether you\\'re a good hacker, especially when\\nyou\\'re young.  Fortunately the process of starting startups tends\\nto select them automatically.  What drives people to start startups\\nis (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don\\'t \\nthese guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?  And that\\'s \\nalso a sign that one is a good hacker.I put the lower bound at 23 not because there\\'s something that\\ndoesn\\'t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see\\nwhat it\\'s like in an existing business before you try running your\\nown.  The business doesn\\'t have to be a startup.  I spent a year\\nworking for a software company to pay off my college loans.  It was\\nthe worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing  \\nit at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business.\\nIn this case they were mostly negative lessons: don\\'t have a lot\\nof meetings; don\\'t have chunks of code that multiple people own;\\ndon\\'t have a sales guy running the company; don\\'t make a high-end\\nproduct; don\\'t let your code get too big; don\\'t leave finding bugs\\nto QA people; don\\'t go too long between releases; don\\'t isolate\\ndevelopers from users; don\\'t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and\\nso on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive \\nones.  Perhaps even more valuable: it\\'s hard to repeat a brilliant\\nperformance, but it\\'s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]The other reason it\\'s hard to start a company before 23 is that     \\npeople won\\'t take you seriously.  VCs won\\'t trust you, and will try\\nto reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.  Customers\\nwill worry you\\'re going to flake out and leave them stranded.  Even\\nyou yourself, unless you\\'re very unusual, will feel your age to     \\nsome degree; you\\'ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much \\nolder than you, and if you\\'re 21, hiring only people younger rather \\nlimits your options.Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to.\\nBill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.  (Paul \\nAllen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if\\nyou\\'re thinking, I don\\'t care what he says, I\\'m going to start a\\ncompany now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with\\nit.The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.  One reason I put \\nit there is that I don\\'t think many people have the physical stamina\\nmuch past that age.   I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every\\nnight, seven days a week.  I don\\'t know if I could do that now.Also,\\nstartups are a big risk financially.  If you try something that\\nblows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year\\nolds are broke.  By 38 you can\\'t take so many risks-- especially\\nif you have kids.My final test may be the most restrictive.  Do you actually want\\nto start a startup?  What it amounts to, economically, is compressing\\nyour working life into the smallest possible space.  Instead of\\nworking at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for \\nfour.  And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it\\nprobably won\\'t take four years.During this time you\\'ll do little but work, because when you\\'re not\\nworking, your competitors will be.  My only leisure activities were\\nrunning, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about\\nfifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a total\\nof two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks I\\nwould take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a  \\nfriend\\'s house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice.\\nOtherwise I just worked.Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some\\nof my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting.\\nBut only about 10% of the time.  The best I can say for the other\\n90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then.\\nLike the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours,\\nand we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered\\ngenerator inside our offices. I won\\'t try that again.I don\\'t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a\\nstartup is more than you\\'d endure in an ordinary working life.  It\\'s\\nprobably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it\\'s       \\ncompressed into a short period.  So mainly what a startup buys you \\nis time.  That\\'s the way to think about it if you\\'re trying to \\ndecide whether to start one.  If you\\'re the sort of person who would\\nlike to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working \\nfor a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate\\nschool.  Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people,\\nto start software startups.  You may worry that if you do you\\'ll   \\nblow your chances of an academic career.  But it\\'s possible to be  \\npart of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.  \\nTwo of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole \\ntime, and both got their degrees. \\nThere are few sources of energy\\nso powerful as a procrastinating grad student.If you do have to\\nleave grad school, in the worst case it won\\'t be for too long.  If\\na startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can \\nreturn to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no   \\nlonger have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the great\\nmystery it seems from outside.  It\\'s not something you have to know\\nabout \"business\" to do.  Build something users love, and spend less\\nthan you make.  How hard is that?Notes[1] Google\\'s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes\\nfrom ads on other sites.[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that\\nthere are no discrimination laws about starting businesses.  For   \\nexample, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman\\nwho had small children, or was likely to have them soon.  But you\\'re\\nnot allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids \\nsoon.  Believe it or not, under current US law, you\\'re not even   \\nallowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence.  Whereas when\\nyou\\'re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you\\nwant about who you start it with.[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because\\nyou can do it mostly on your own.  For the price of a Linux box, a\\ncopy of K&R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor\\'s fifteen\\nyear old son, you\\'ll be well on your way.[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest\\ncompany of all, the government.  Yes, there are lots of opportunities\\nto sell them technology.  But let someone else start those startups.[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care \\nabout the paperwork there, and that there\\'s more of it.  Which helps\\nexplain why there are not more startups in Germany.[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because\\nJulian got 10% of the company.  But this is a very misleading number,\\nbecause the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you.\\nThere will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick\\nyour brains.  But you can never tell for sure which these are, so\\nthe best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention\\na few critical technical secrets.[8]  I was as bad an employee as this place was a company.  I\\napologize to anyone who had to work with me there.[9]  You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business\\nby doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston,\\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this essay, and to Steve\\nMelendez and Gregory Price for inviting me to speak.Domain Name SearchTurkish TranslationHebrew TranslationRussian TranslationChinese TranslationFrench TranslationJapanese TranslationArabic Translation\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Get funded by\\nY Combinator.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 2013One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is\\nto do things that don\\'t scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe\\nthat startups either take off or don\\'t.  You build something, make\\nit available, and if you\\'ve made a better mousetrap, people beat a\\npath to your door as promised.  Or they don\\'t, in which case the\\nmarket must not exist.\\n[1]Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off.\\nThere may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually\\nit takes some sort of push to get them going.  A good metaphor would\\nbe the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters.\\nOnce the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a\\nseparate and laborious process to get it going.RecruitThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start\\nis to recruit users manually.  Nearly all startups have to.  You\\ncan\\'t wait for users to come to you.  You have to go out and get\\nthem.Stripe is one of the most successful startups we\\'ve funded, and the\\nproblem they solved was an urgent one.   If anyone could have sat\\nback and waited for users, it was Stripe.  But in fact they\\'re\\nfamous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.Startups building things for other startups have a big pool of\\npotential users in the other companies we\\'ve funded, and none took\\nbetter advantage of it than Stripe.  At YC we use the term \"Collison\\ninstallation\" for the technique they invented.  More diffident\\nfounders ask \"Will you try our beta?\" and if the answer is yes,\\nthey say \"Great, we\\'ll send you a link.\"  But the Collison brothers\\nweren\\'t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they\\'d say\\n\"Right then, give me your laptop\" and set them up on the spot.There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users\\nindividually.  One is a combination of shyness and laziness.  They\\'d\\nrather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of\\nstrangers and probably be rejected by most of them.  But for a\\nstartup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will\\nhave to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.\\n[2]The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute\\nnumbers seem so small at first.  This can\\'t be how the big, famous\\nstartups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to\\nunderestimate the power of compound growth.  We encourage every\\nstartup to measure their progress by weekly growth\\nrate.  If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week\\nto grow 10% a week.  And while 110 may not seem much better than\\n100, if you keep growing at 10% a week you\\'ll be surprised how big\\nthe numbers get.  After a year you\\'ll have 14,000 users, and after\\n2 years you\\'ll have 2 million.You\\'ll be doing different things when you\\'re acquiring users a\\nthousand at a time, and growth has to slow down eventually.  But\\nif the market exists you can usually start by recruiting users\\nmanually and then gradually switch to less manual methods. \\n[3]Airbnb is a classic example of this technique.  Marketplaces are\\nso hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures\\nat first. In Airbnb\\'s case, these consisted of going door to door\\nin New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve\\ntheir listings.  When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture\\nthem with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners\\nthey\\'d always just flown back from somewhere.FragileAirbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it\\nwas so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in\\nperson with users made the difference between success and failure.That initial fragility was not a unique feature of Airbnb.  Almost\\nall startups are fragile initially.  And that\\'s one of the biggest\\nthings inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and\\nknow-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.  They unconsciously\\njudge larval startups by the standards of established ones.  They\\'re\\nlike someone looking at a newborn baby and concluding \"there\\'s no\\nway this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything.\"It\\'s harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup.\\nThey always get things wrong.   It\\'s even ok if investors dismiss\\nyour startup; they\\'ll change their minds when they see growth.  The\\nbig danger is that you\\'ll dismiss your startup yourself.  I\\'ve seen\\nit happen.  I often have to encourage founders who don\\'t see the\\nfull potential of what they\\'re building.  Even Bill Gates made that\\nmistake.  He returned to Harvard for the fall semester after starting\\nMicrosoft.  He didn\\'t stay long, but he wouldn\\'t have returned at\\nall if he\\'d realized Microsoft was going to be even a fraction of\\nthe size it turned out to be. \\n[4]The question to ask about an early stage startup is not \"is this\\ncompany taking over the world?\"  but \"how big could this company\\nget if the founders did the right things?\"  And the right things\\noften seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time. Microsoft\\ncan\\'t have seemed very impressive when it was just a couple guys\\nin Albuquerque writing Basic interpreters for a market of a few\\nthousand hobbyists (as they were then called), but in retrospect\\nthat was the optimal path to dominating microcomputer software.\\nAnd I know Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn\\'t feel like they were\\nen route to the big time as they were taking \"professional\" photos\\nof their first hosts\\' apartments.  They were just trying to survive.\\nBut in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big\\nmarket.How do you find users to recruit manually?  If you build something\\nto solve your own problems, then\\nyou only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward.\\nOtherwise you\\'ll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate\\nthe most promising vein of users.  The usual way to do that is to\\nget some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted\\nlaunch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and\\nseek out more like them.  For example, Ben Silbermann noticed that\\na lot of the earliest Pinterest users were interested in design,\\nso he went to a conference of design bloggers to recruit users, and\\nthat worked well. \\n[5]DelightYou should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users,\\nbut also to make them happy.  For as long as they could (which\\nturned out to be surprisingly long), Wufoo sent each new user a\\nhand-written thank you note.  Your first users should feel that\\nsigning up with you was one of the best choices they ever made.\\nAnd you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways\\nto delight them.Why do we have to teach startups this?  Why is it counterintuitive\\nfor founders?  Three reasons, I think.One is that a lot of startup founders are trained as engineers,\\nand customer service is not part of the training of engineers.\\nYou\\'re supposed to build things that are robust and elegant, not\\nbe slavishly attentive to individual users like some kind of\\nsalesperson.  Ironically, part of the reason engineering is\\ntraditionally averse to handholding is that its traditions date\\nfrom a time when engineers were less powerful — when they were\\nonly in charge of their narrow domain of building things, rather\\nthan running the whole show.  You can be ornery when you\\'re Scotty,\\nbut not when you\\'re Kirk.Another reason founders don\\'t focus enough on individual customers\\nis that they worry it won\\'t scale.  But when founders of larval\\nstartups worry about this, I point out that in their current state\\nthey have nothing to lose.  Maybe if they go out of their way to\\nmake existing users super happy, they\\'ll one day have too many to\\ndo so much for.  That would be a great problem to have.  See if you\\ncan make it happen.  And incidentally, when it does, you\\'ll find\\nthat delighting customers scales better than you expected.  Partly\\nbecause you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than\\nyou would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers\\nwill by then have permeated your culture.I have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying\\ntoo hard to make their initial users happy.But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing\\nhow attentive they could be to their users is that they\\'ve never\\nexperienced such attention themselves.  Their standards for customer\\nservice have been set by the companies they\\'ve been customers of,\\nwhich are mostly big ones.  Tim Cook doesn\\'t send you a hand-written\\nnote after you buy a laptop.  He can\\'t.  But you can.  That\\'s one\\nadvantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big\\ncompany can. \\n[6]Once you realize that existing conventions are not the upper bound\\non user experience, it\\'s interesting in a very pleasant way to think\\nabout how far you could go to delight your users.ExperienceI was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention\\nto users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it:\\ninsanely great.  Steve wasn\\'t just using \"insanely\" as a synonym\\nfor \"very.\"  He meant it more literally — that one should focus\\non quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be\\nconsidered pathological.All the most successful startups we\\'ve funded have, and that probably\\ndoesn\\'t surprise would-be founders.  What novice founders don\\'t get\\nis what insanely great translates to in a larval startup.  When\\nSteve Jobs started using that phrase, Apple was already an established\\ncompany.  He meant the Mac (and its documentation and even\\npackaging — such is the nature of obsession) should be insanely\\nwell designed and manufactured.  That\\'s not hard for engineers to\\ngrasp.  It\\'s just a more extreme version of designing a robust and\\nelegant product.What founders have a hard time grasping (and Steve himself might\\nhave had a hard time grasping) is what insanely great morphs into\\nas you roll the time slider back to the first couple months of a\\nstartup\\'s life.  It\\'s not the product that should be insanely great,\\nbut the experience of being your user.  The product is just one\\ncomponent of that.  For a big company it\\'s necessarily the dominant\\none.  But you can and should give users an insanely great experience\\nwith an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the\\ndifference with attentiveness.Can, perhaps, but should?  Yes.  Over-engaging with early users is\\nnot just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling.  For\\nmost successful startups it\\'s a necessary part of the feedback loop\\nthat makes the product good.  Making a better mousetrap is not an\\natomic operation.  Even if you start the way most successful startups\\nhave, by building something you yourself need, the first thing you\\nbuild is never quite right.  And except in domains with big penalties\\nfor making mistakes, it\\'s often better not to aim for perfection\\ninitially.  In software, especially, it usually works best to get\\nsomething in front of users as soon as it has a quantum of utility,\\nand then see what they do with it.  Perfectionism is often an excuse\\nfor procrastination, and in any case your initial model of users\\nis always inaccurate, even if you\\'re one of them. \\n[7]The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users\\nwill be the best you ever get.  When you\\'re so big you have to\\nresort to focus groups, you\\'ll wish you could go over to your users\\'\\nhomes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when\\nthere were only a handful of them.FireSometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately\\nnarrow market.  It\\'s like keeping a fire contained at first to get\\nit really hot before adding more logs.That\\'s what Facebook did.  At first it was just for Harvard students.\\nIn that form it only had a potential market of a few thousand people,\\nbut because they felt it was really for them, a critical mass of\\nthem signed up.  After Facebook stopped being for Harvard students,\\nit remained for students at specific colleges for quite a while.\\nWhen I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg at Startup School, he said that\\nwhile it was a lot of work creating course lists for each school,\\ndoing that made students feel the site was their natural home.Any startup that could be described as a marketplace usually has\\nto start in a subset of the market, but this can work for other\\nstartups as well.  It\\'s always worth asking if there\\'s a subset of\\nthe market in which you can get a critical mass of users quickly.\\n[8]Most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously.\\nThey build something for themselves and their friends, who happen\\nto be the early adopters, and only realize later that they could\\noffer it to a broader market.  The strategy works just as well if\\nyou do it unconsciously.  The biggest danger of not being consciously\\naware of this pattern is for those who naively discard part of it.\\nE.g. if you don\\'t build something for yourself and your friends,\\nor even if you do, but you come from the corporate world and your\\nfriends are not early adopters, you\\'ll no longer have a perfect\\ninitial market handed to you on a platter.Among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups.\\nThey\\'re more open to new things both by nature and because, having\\njust been started, they haven\\'t made all their choices yet.  Plus\\nwhen they succeed they grow fast, and you with them.  It was one\\nof many unforeseen advantages of the YC model (and specifically of\\nmaking YC big) that B2B startups now have an instant market of\\nhundreds of other startups ready at hand.MerakiFor hardware startups there\\'s a variant of\\ndoing things that don\\'t scale that we call \"pulling a Meraki.\"\\nAlthough we didn\\'t fund Meraki, the founders were Robert Morris\\'s\\ngrad students, so we know their history.  They got started by doing\\nsomething that really doesn\\'t scale: assembling their routers\\nthemselves.Hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don\\'t.\\nThe minimum order for a factory production run is usually several\\nhundred thousand dollars.  Which can put you in a catch-22: without\\na product you can\\'t generate the growth you need to raise the money\\nto manufacture your product.  Back when hardware startups had to\\nrely on investors for money, you had to be pretty convincing to\\novercome this.  The arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely,\\npreorders) has helped a lot.  But even so I\\'d advise startups to\\npull a Meraki initially if they can.  That\\'s what Pebble did.  The\\nPebbles \\nassembled\\n the first several hundred watches themselves. If\\nthey hadn\\'t gone through that phase, they probably wouldn\\'t have\\nsold $10 million worth of watches when they did go on Kickstarter.Like paying excessive attention to early customers, fabricating\\nthings yourself turns out to be valuable for hardware startups.\\nYou can tweak the design faster when you\\'re the factory, and you\\nlearn things you\\'d never have known otherwise.  Eric Migicovsky of\\nPebble said one of the things he learned was \"how valuable it was to\\nsource good screws.\"   Who knew?ConsultSometimes we advise founders of B2B startups to take over-engagement\\nto an extreme, and to pick a single user and act as if they were\\nconsultants building something just for that one user.   The initial\\nuser serves as the form for your mold; keep tweaking till you fit\\ntheir needs perfectly, and you\\'ll usually find you\\'ve made something\\nother users want too.  Even if there aren\\'t many of them, there are\\nprobably adjacent territories that have more.  As long as you can\\nfind just one user who really needs something and can act on that\\nneed, you\\'ve got a toehold in making something people want, and\\nthat\\'s as much as any startup needs initially. \\n[9]Consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn\\'t scale.\\nBut (like other ways of bestowing one\\'s favors liberally) it\\'s safe\\nto do it so long as you\\'re not being paid to.  That\\'s where companies\\ncross the line.  So long as you\\'re a product company that\\'s merely\\nbeing extra attentive to a customer, they\\'re very grateful even if\\nyou don\\'t solve all their problems.  But when they start paying you\\nspecifically for that attentiveness — when they start paying\\nyou by the hour — they expect you to do everything.Another consulting-like technique for recruiting initially lukewarm\\nusers is to use your software yourselves on their behalf.  We\\ndid that at Viaweb.  When we approached merchants asking if they\\nwanted to use our software to make online stores, some said no, but\\nthey\\'d let us make one for them.  Since we would do anything to get\\nusers, we did.  We felt pretty lame at the time.  Instead of\\norganizing big strategic e-commerce partnerships, we were trying\\nto sell luggage and pens and men\\'s shirts.  But in retrospect it\\nwas exactly the right thing to do, because it taught us how it would\\nfeel to merchants to use our software.  Sometimes the feedback loop\\nwas near instantaneous: in the middle of building some merchant\\'s\\nsite I\\'d find I needed a feature we didn\\'t have, so I\\'d spend a\\ncouple hours implementing it and then resume building the site.ManualThere\\'s a more extreme variant where you don\\'t just use your software,\\nbut are your software.  When you only have a small number of users,\\nyou can sometimes get away with doing by hand things that you plan\\nto automate later.  This lets you launch faster, and when you do\\nfinally automate yourself out of the loop, you\\'ll know exactly what\\nto build because you\\'ll have muscle memory from doing it yourself.When manual components look to the user like software, this technique\\nstarts to have aspects of a practical joke.  For example, the way\\nStripe delivered \"instant\" merchant accounts to its first users was\\nthat the founders manually signed them up for traditional merchant\\naccounts behind the scenes.Some startups could be entirely manual at first. If you can find\\nsomeone with a problem that needs solving and you can solve it\\nmanually, go ahead and do that for as long as you can, and then\\ngradually automate the bottlenecks.  It would be a little frightening\\nto be solving users\\' problems in a way that wasn\\'t yet automatic,\\nbut less frightening than the far more common case of having something\\nautomatic that doesn\\'t yet solve anyone\\'s problems.BigI should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn\\'t\\nwork: the Big Launch.  I occasionally meet founders who seem to\\nbelieve startups are projectiles rather than powered aircraft, and\\nthat they\\'ll make it big if and only if they\\'re launched with\\nsufficient initial velocity.  They want to launch simultaneously\\nin 8 different publications, with embargoes.  And on a tuesday, of\\ncourse, since they read somewhere that\\'s the optimum day to launch\\nsomething.It\\'s easy to see how little launches matter.  Think of some successful\\nstartups.  How many of their launches do you remember?\\nAll you need from a launch is some initial core of users.  How well\\nyou\\'re doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you\\nmade those users than how many there were of them.\\n[10]So why do founders think launches matter?  A combination of solipsism\\nand laziness.  They think what they\\'re building is so great that\\neveryone who hears about it will immediately sign up.  Plus it would\\nbe so much less work if you could get users merely by broadcasting\\nyour existence, rather than recruiting them one at a time.  But\\neven if what you\\'re building really is great, getting users will\\nalways be a gradual process — partly because great things\\nare usually also novel, but mainly because users have other things\\nto think about.Partnerships too usually don\\'t work.  They don\\'t work for startups\\nin general, but they especially don\\'t work as a way to get growth\\nstarted.  It\\'s a common mistake among inexperienced founders to\\nbelieve that a partnership with a big company will be their big\\nbreak.  Six months later they\\'re all saying the same thing: that\\nwas way more work than we expected, and we ended up getting practically\\nnothing out of it. \\n[11]It\\'s not enough just to do something extraordinary initially.  You\\nhave to make an extraordinary effort initially.  Any strategy\\nthat omits the effort — whether it\\'s expecting a big launch to\\nget you users, or a big partner — is ipso facto suspect.VectorThe need to do something unscalably laborious to get started is so\\nnearly universal that it might be a good idea to stop thinking of\\nstartup ideas as scalars.  Instead we should try thinking of them\\nas pairs of what you\\'re going to build, plus the unscalable thing(s)\\nyou\\'re going to do initially to get the company going.It could be interesting to start viewing startup ideas this way,\\nbecause now that there are two components you can try to be imaginative\\nabout the second as well as the first.  But in most cases the second\\ncomponent will be what it usually is — recruit users manually\\nand give them an overwhelmingly good experience — and the main\\nbenefit of treating startups as vectors will be to remind founders\\nthey need to work hard in two dimensions.\\n[12]In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your\\ncompany\\'s DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started\\nare not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently\\nfor the better.  If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition\\nwhen you\\'re small, you\\'ll probably still be aggressive when you\\'re\\nbig.  If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your\\nsoftware on users\\'s behalf, you\\'ll learn things you couldn\\'t have\\nlearned otherwise.  And most importantly, if you have to work hard\\nto delight users when you only have a handful of them, you\\'ll keep\\ndoing it when you have a lot.Notes[1]\\nActually Emerson never mentioned mousetraps specifically.  He\\nwrote \"If a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell,\\nor can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs,\\nthan anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his\\nhouse, though it be in the woods.\"[2]\\nThanks to Sam Altman for suggesting I make this explicit.\\nAnd no, you can\\'t avoid doing sales by hiring someone to do it for\\nyou.  You have to do sales yourself initially.  Later you can hire\\na real salesperson to replace you.[3]\\nThe reason this works is that as you get bigger, your size\\nhelps you grow.  Patrick Collison wrote \"At some point, there was\\na very noticeable change in how Stripe felt. It tipped from being\\nthis boulder we had to push to being a train car that in fact had\\nits own momentum.\"[4]\\nOne of the more subtle ways in which YC can help founders\\nis by calibrating their ambitions, because we know exactly how a\\nlot of successful startups looked when they were just getting\\nstarted.[5]\\nIf you\\'re building something for which you can\\'t easily get\\na small set of users to observe — e.g. enterprise software — and\\nin a domain where you have no connections, you\\'ll have to rely on\\ncold calls and introductions.  But should you even be working on\\nsuch an idea?[6]\\nGarry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into\\nin the beginning.  They want so much to seem big that they imitate\\neven the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual\\nusers.  This seems to them more \"professional.\"  Actually it\\'s\\nbetter to embrace the fact that you\\'re small and use whatever\\nadvantages that brings.[7]\\nYour user model almost couldn\\'t be perfectly accurate, because\\nusers\\' needs often change in response to what you build for them.\\nBuild them a microcomputer, and suddenly they need to run spreadsheets\\non it, because the arrival of your new microcomputer causes someone\\nto invent the spreadsheet.[8]\\nIf you have to choose between the subset that will sign up\\nquickest and those that will pay the most, it\\'s usually best to\\npick the former, because those are probably the early adopters.\\nThey\\'ll have a better influence on your product, and they won\\'t\\nmake you expend as much effort on sales.  And though they have less\\nmoney, you don\\'t need that much to maintain your target growth rate\\nearly on.[9]\\nYes, I can imagine cases where you could end up making\\nsomething that was really only useful for one user.  But those are\\nusually obvious, even to inexperienced founders.  So if it\\'s not\\nobvious you\\'d be making something for a market of one, don\\'t worry\\nabout that danger.[10]\\nThere may even be an inverse correlation between launch\\nmagnitude and success.  The only launches I remember are famous\\nflops like the Segway and Google Wave.  Wave is a particularly\\nalarming example, because I think it was actually a great idea that\\nwas killed partly by its overdone launch.[11]\\nGoogle grew big on the back of Yahoo, but that wasn\\'t a\\npartnership.  Yahoo was their customer.[12]\\nIt will also remind founders that an idea where the second\\ncomponent is empty — an idea where there is nothing you can do\\nto get going, e.g. because you have no way to find users to recruit\\nmanually — is probably a bad idea, at least for those founders.Thanks to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Patrick Collison, Kevin\\nHale, Steven Levy, Jessica Livingston, Geoff Ralston, and Garry Tan for reading\\ndrafts of this.Japanese TranslationRussian TranslationFrench TranslationArabic TranslationItalian TranslationKorean Translation\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Meetings cost them\\nmore.There are two types of schedule, which I\\'ll call the manager\\'s\\nschedule and the maker\\'s schedule.  The manager\\'s schedule is for\\nbosses.  It\\'s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with\\neach day cut into one hour intervals.  You can block off several\\nhours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change\\nwhat you\\'re doing every hour.When you use time that way, it\\'s merely a practical problem to meet\\nwith someone.  Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and\\nyou\\'re done.Most powerful people are on the manager\\'s schedule.  It\\'s the\\nschedule of command.  But there\\'s another way of using time that\\'s\\ncommon among people who make things, like programmers and writers.\\nThey generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.\\nYou can\\'t write or program well in units of an hour.  That\\'s barely\\nenough time to get started.When you\\'re operating on the maker\\'s schedule, meetings are a\\ndisaster.  A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking\\nit into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.  Plus you\\nhave to remember to go to the meeting.  That\\'s no problem for someone\\non the manager\\'s schedule.  There\\'s always something coming on the\\nnext hour; the only question is what.  But when someone on the\\nmaker\\'s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.For someone on the maker\\'s schedule, having a meeting is like\\nthrowing an exception.  It doesn\\'t merely cause you to switch from\\none task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day.   A meeting\\ncommonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or\\nafternoon.  But in addition there\\'s sometimes a cascading effect.\\nIf I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I\\'m slightly less\\nlikely to start something ambitious in the morning.  I know this\\nmay sound oversensitive, but if you\\'re a maker, think of your own\\ncase.  Don\\'t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire\\nday free to work, with no appointments at all?  Well, that means\\nyour spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don\\'t.  And\\nambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your\\ncapacity.  A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.Each type of schedule works fine by itself.  Problems arise when\\nthey meet.  Since most powerful people operate on the manager\\'s\\nschedule, they\\'re in a position to make everyone resonate at their\\nfrequency if they want to.  But the smarter ones restrain themselves,\\nif they know that some of the people working for them need long\\nchunks of time to work in.Our case is an unusual one.  Nearly all investors, including all\\nVCs I know, operate on the manager\\'s schedule.  But \\nY Combinator\\nruns on the maker\\'s schedule.  Rtm and Trevor and I do because we\\nalways have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she\\'s gotten\\ninto sync with us.I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there start to be more companies like\\nus.  I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at\\nleast postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago\\nthey started to be able to resist switching from jeans\\nto suits.How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker\\'s schedule?\\nBy using the classic device for simulating the manager\\'s schedule\\nwithin the maker\\'s: office hours.  Several times a week I set aside\\na chunk of time to meet founders we\\'ve funded.  These chunks of\\ntime are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program\\nthat ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours\\nare clustered at the end.  Because they come at the end of my day\\nthese meetings are never an interruption.  (Unless their working\\nday ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts\\ntheirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to\\nthem.)  During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough\\nthat they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.\\nWhen we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved\\nanother trick for partitioning the day.  I used to program from\\ndinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could\\ninterrupt me.  Then I\\'d sleep till about 11 am, and come in and\\nwork until dinner on what I called \"business stuff.\"  I never thought\\nof it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day,\\none on the manager\\'s schedule and one on the maker\\'s.When you\\'re operating on the manager\\'s schedule you can do something\\nyou\\'d never want to do on the maker\\'s: you can have speculative\\nmeetings.  You can meet someone just to get to know one another.\\nIf you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not?  Maybe it will\\nturn out you can help one another in some way.Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that\\nmatter) have speculative meetings all the time.  They\\'re effectively\\nfree if you\\'re on the manager\\'s schedule.  They\\'re so common that\\nthere\\'s distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you\\nwant to \"grab coffee,\" for example.Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you\\'re on the maker\\'s\\nschedule, though.  Which puts us in something of a bind.  Everyone\\nassumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager\\'s schedule.\\nSo they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or\\nsend us an email proposing we grab coffee.  At this point we have\\ntwo options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose\\nhalf a day\\'s work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably\\noffend them.Till recently we weren\\'t clear in our own minds about the source\\nof the problem.  We just took it for granted that we had to either\\nblow our schedules or offend people.  But now that I\\'ve realized\\nwhat\\'s going on, perhaps there\\'s a third option: to write something\\nexplaining the two types of schedule.  Maybe eventually, if the\\nconflict between the manager\\'s schedule and the maker\\'s schedule\\nstarts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a\\nproblem.Those of us on the maker\\'s schedule are willing to compromise.   We\\nknow we have to have some number of meetings.  All we ask from those\\non the manager\\'s schedule is that they understand the cost.\\nThanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,\\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Related:How to Do What You LoveGood and Bad ProcrastinationTurkish TranslationFrench TranslationKorean TranslationGerman Translation\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html', 'title': 'The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups', 'language': 'No language found.'}, page_content='The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\\nY Combinator.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOctober 2006In the Q & A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made\\nstartups fail.  After standing there gaping for a few seconds I\\nrealized this was kind of a trick question.  It\\'s equivalent to\\nasking how to make a startup succeed — if you avoid every cause of\\nfailure, you succeed — and that\\'s too big a question to answer on\\nthe fly.Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem\\nfrom this direction.  If you have a list of all the things you\\nshouldn\\'t do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just\\nby negating.  And this form of list may be more useful in practice.\\nIt\\'s easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn\\'t than\\nalways to remember to do something you should.\\n[1]In a sense there\\'s just one mistake that kills startups: not making\\nsomething users want.  If you make something users want, you\\'ll\\nprobably be fine, whatever else you do or don\\'t do.  And if you\\ndon\\'t make something users want, then you\\'re dead, whatever else\\nyou do or don\\'t do.  So really this is a list of 18 things that\\ncause startups not to make something users want.  Nearly all failure\\nfunnels through that.1. Single FounderHave you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by\\njust one person?  Even companies you think of as having one founder,\\nlike Oracle, usually turn out to have more.  It seems unlikely this\\nis a coincidence.What\\'s wrong with having one founder?  To start with, it\\'s a vote\\nof no confidence.  It probably means the founder couldn\\'t talk any\\nof his friends into starting the company with him.  That\\'s pretty\\nalarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.But even if the founder\\'s friends were all wrong and the company\\nis a good bet, he\\'s still at a disadvantage.  Starting a startup\\nis too hard for one person.  Even if you could do all the work\\nyourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out\\nof stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.The last one might be the most important.  The low points in a\\nstartup are so low that few could bear them alone.  When you have\\nmultiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way\\nthat seems to violate conservation laws.  Each thinks \"I can\\'t let\\nmy friends down.\"  This is one of the most powerful forces in human\\nnature, and it\\'s missing when there\\'s just one founder.2. Bad LocationStartups prosper in some places and not others.  Silicon Valley\\ndominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.  After\\nthat there\\'s not much.  Even in New York the number of startups per\\ncapita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.  In towns\\nlike Houston and Chicago and Detroit it\\'s too small to measure.Why is the falloff so sharp?  Probably for the same reason it is\\nin other industries.  What\\'s the sixth largest fashion center in\\nthe US?  The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing?\\nWhatever they are they\\'re probably so far from the top that it would\\nbe misleading even to call them centers.It\\'s an interesting question why cities \\nbecome startup hubs, but\\nthe reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is\\nfor any industry: that\\'s where the experts are.  Standards are\\nhigher; people are more sympathetic to what you\\'re doing; the kind\\nof people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries\\nare there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the\\nsame business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost\\nstartups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it\\'s\\nclear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.3. Marginal NicheMost of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common\\nproblem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding\\ncompetition.If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a\\ncertain age they\\'re afraid of the ball.  When the ball comes near\\nthem their instinct is to avoid it.  I didn\\'t make a lot of catches\\nas an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came\\nmy way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for\\nprotection than in the hope of catching it.Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight\\nyear old strategy for dealing with fly balls.  If you make anything\\ngood, you\\'re going to have competitors, so you may as well face\\nthat.  You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious.\\nIt\\'s not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue\\nsmaller ones because they seem safer.  Your unconscious won\\'t even\\nlet you think of grand ideas.  So the solution may be to think about\\nideas without involving yourself.  What would be a great idea for\\nsomeone else to do as a startup?4. Derivative IdeaMany of the applications we get are imitations of some existing\\ncompany.  That\\'s one source of ideas, but not the best.  If you\\nlook at the origins of successful startups, few were started in\\nimitation of some other startup.  Where did they get their ideas?\\nUsually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.Our startup made software for making online stores.  When we started\\nit, there wasn\\'t any; the few sites you could order from were\\nhand-made at great expense by web consultants.  We knew that if\\nonline shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated\\nby software, so we wrote some.  Pretty straightforward.It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you\\npersonally.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer,\\nGoogle because Larry and Sergey couldn\\'t find stuff online, Hotmail\\nbecause Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn\\'t exchange email at\\nwork.So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the\\nFacebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction.\\nInstead of starting from companies and working back to the problems\\nthey solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might\\nsolve them. \\n[2]\\nWhat do people complain about?  What do you wish there was?5. ObstinacyIn some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you\\nwant to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you\\nencounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-vision\\napproach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,\\nwhere the problem is well-defined.  Startups are more like science,\\nwhere you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.So don\\'t get too attached to your original plan, because it\\'s\\nprobably wrong.  Most successful startups end up doing something\\ndifferent than they originally intended — often so different that\\nit doesn\\'t even seem like the same company.  You have to be prepared\\nto see the better idea when it arrives.  And the hardest part of\\nthat is often discarding your old idea.But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.  Switching\\nto a new idea every week will be equally fatal.  Is there some kind\\nof external test you can use?  One is to ask whether the ideas\\nrepresent some kind of progression.  If in each new idea you\\'re\\nable to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then\\nyou\\'re probably in a process that converges.  Whereas if you keep\\nrestarting from scratch, that\\'s a bad sign.Fortunately there\\'s someone you can ask for advice: your users.  If\\nyou\\'re thinking about turning in some new direction and your users\\nseem excited about it, it\\'s probably a good bet.6. Hiring Bad ProgrammersI forgot to include this in the early versions of the list,\\nbecause nearly all the founders I know are programmers.  This is\\nnot a serious problem for them.  They might accidentally hire someone\\nbad, but it\\'s not going to kill the company.  In a pinch they can\\ndo whatever\\'s required themselves.But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the\\ne-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.  A lot\\nof those companies were started by business guys who thought the\\nway startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired\\nprogrammers to implement it.  That\\'s actually much harder than it\\nsounds — almost impossibly hard in fact — because business guys\\ncan\\'t tell which are the good programmers.  They don\\'t even get a\\nshot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job\\nimplementing the vision of a business guy.In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people\\nthey think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that\\nhe\\'s a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren\\'t.  Then they\\'re\\nmystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War\\nII bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters.\\nThis kind of startup is in the same position as a big company,\\nbut without the advantages.So how do you pick good programmers if you\\'re not a programmer?  I\\ndon\\'t think there\\'s an answer.  I was about to say you\\'d have to\\nfind a good programmer to help you hire people.  But if you can\\'t\\nrecognize good programmers, how would you even do that?7. Choosing the Wrong PlatformA related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers)\\nis choosing the wrong platform.  For example, I think a lot of\\nstartups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build\\nserver-based applications on Windows.  Hotmail was still running\\non FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because\\nWindows couldn\\'t handle the load.  If Hotmail\\'s founders\\nhad chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.PayPal only just dodged this bullet.  After they merged with X.com,\\nthe new CEO wanted to switch to Windows — even after PayPal cofounder\\nMax Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on\\nWindows as Unix.  Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.Platform is a vague word.  It could mean an operating system, or a\\nprogramming language, or a \"framework\" built on top of a programming\\nlanguage.  It implies something that both supports and limits, like\\nthe foundation of a house.The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that\\nseem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like\\nWindows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.  Java\\napplets were probably the most spectacular example.  This was\\nsupposed to be the new way of delivering applications.  Presumably\\nit killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.How do you pick the right platforms?  The usual way is to hire good\\nprogrammers and let them choose.  But there is a trick you could\\nuse if you\\'re not a programmer: visit a top computer science\\ndepartment and see what they use in research projects.8. Slowness in LaunchingCompanies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.  It\\'s\\nintrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.  It takes an\\neffort of will to push through this and get something released to\\nusers.\\n[3]Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.  Most\\nare equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday\\nlife.  There\\'s something that needs to happen first.  Maybe.  But\\nif the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push\\nof a button, would they still be waiting?One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually\\nfinish some quantum of work.  Nothing is truly finished till it\\'s\\nreleased; you can see that from the rush of work that\\'s always\\ninvolved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought\\nit was.  The other reason you need to launch is that it\\'s only by\\nbouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching:\\nworking too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of\\nhaving to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too\\nmany different things; excessive perfectionism.  Fortunately you\\ncan combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself\\nto launch something fairly quickly.9. Launching Too EarlyLaunching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more\\nstartups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too\\nfast.  The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.  You launch\\nsomething, the early adopters try it out, and if it\\'s no good they\\nmay never come back.So what\\'s the minimum you need to launch?  We suggest startups think\\nabout what they plan to do, identify a core that\\'s both (a) useful\\non its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded\\ninto the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for\\nwriting software.  Think about the overall goal, then start by\\nwriting the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.  If\\nit\\'s a subset, you\\'ll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case\\nyou won\\'t be wasting your time.  But more likely you\\'ll find that\\nimplementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you\\nsee more clearly what the rest should do.The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.  They\\ndon\\'t expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has\\nto do something.10. Having No Specific User in MindYou can\\'t build things users like without understanding them.  I\\nmentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have\\nbegun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.  Perhaps\\nthere\\'s a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how\\nwell you understand the problem you\\'re solving, and the problems\\nyou understand best are your own. \\n[4]That\\'s just a theory.  What\\'s not a theory is the converse: if\\nyou\\'re trying to solve problems you don\\'t understand, you\\'re hosed.And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to\\nassume that someone, they\\'re not sure exactly who, will want what\\nthey\\'re building.  Do the founders want it?  No, they\\'re not the\\ntarget market.  Who is?  Teenagers.  People interested in local\\nevents (that one is a perennial tarpit).  Or \"business\" users.  What\\nbusiness users?  Gas stations?  Movie studios?  Defense contractors?You can of course build something for users other than yourself.\\nWe did.  But you should realize you\\'re stepping into dangerous\\nterritory.  You\\'re flying on instruments, in effect, so you should\\n(a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on\\nyour intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the\\ninstruments.In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing for\\nother people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guess\\nwhat will work; you have to find users and measure their responses.\\nSo if you\\'re going to make something for teenagers or \"business\"\\nusers or some other group that doesn\\'t include you, you have to be\\nable to talk some specific ones into using what you\\'re making.  If\\nyou can\\'t, you\\'re on the wrong track.11. Raising Too Little MoneyMost successful startups take funding at some point.  Like having\\nmore than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.  How much\\nshould you take, though?Startup funding is measured in time.  Every startup that isn\\'t\\nprofitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain\\namount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop.\\nThis is sometimes referred to as runway, as in \"How much runway do\\nyou have left?\"  It\\'s a good metaphor because it reminds you that\\nwhen the money runs out you\\'re going to be airborne or dead.Too little money means not enough to get airborne.  What airborne\\nmeans depends on the situation.  Usually you have to advance to a\\nvisibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype;\\nif you have a prototype, launching; if you\\'re launched, significant\\ngrowth.  It depends on investors, because until you\\'re profitable\\nthat\\'s who you have to convince.So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get\\nto the next step, whatever that is.\\n[5]\\nFortunately you have some\\ncontrol over both how much you spend and what the next step is.  We\\nadvise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically\\nnothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype.\\nThis gives you maximum flexibility.12. Spending Too MuchIt\\'s hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little.\\nIf you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.  The\\nonly way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other\\nstartups.  If you raised five million and ran out of money, you\\nprobably spent too much.Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be.\\nFounders seem to have learned that lesson.  Plus it keeps getting\\ncheaper to start a startup.  So as of this writing few startups\\nspend too much.  None of the ones we\\'ve funded have.  (And not just\\nbecause we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further\\nrounds.)The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people.\\nThis bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows\\nyou down—so money that\\'s getting consumed faster has to last\\nlonger.  Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks\\nexplained it in The Mythical Man-Month.We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don\\'t do it if\\nyou can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary,\\nnot just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who\\nare committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who\\nare either going to write code or go out and get users, because\\nthose are the only things you need at first.13. Raising Too Much MoneyIt\\'s obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such\\na thing as having too much?Yes and no.  The problem is not so much the money itself as what\\ncomes with it.  As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, \"Once you\\ntake several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking.\"\\nIf VCs fund you, they\\'re not going to let you just put the money\\nin the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.  They\\nwant that money to go to work. \\n[6]\\nAt the very least you\\'ll move\\ninto proper office space and hire more people.  That will change\\nthe atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.  Now most of your\\npeople will be employees rather than founders. They won\\'t be as\\ncommitted; they\\'ll need to be told what to do; they\\'ll start to\\nengage in office politics.When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs\\nand has kids.Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets\\nharder to change direction.  Suppose your initial plan was to sell\\nsomething to companies.  After taking VC money you hire a sales\\nforce to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be\\nmaking this for consumers instead of businesses?  That\\'s a completely\\ndifferent kind of selling.  What happens, in practice, is that you\\ndon\\'t realize that.  The more people you have, the more you stay\\npointed in the same direction.Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.  The\\ntime required to raise money grows with the amount.\\n[7]\\nWhen the\\namount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.  VCs\\nnever quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently\\nendless conversation.  Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge\\ntime sink — more work, probably, than the startup itself.   And you\\ndon\\'t want to be spending all your time talking to investors while\\nyour competitors are spending theirs building things.We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first\\nreasonable deal they get.  If you get an offer from a reputable\\nfirm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms,\\njust take it and get on with building the company.\\n[8]\\nWho cares\\nif you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?  Economically, startups\\nare an all-or-nothing game.  Bargain-hunting among investors is a\\nwaste of time.14. Poor Investor ManagementAs a founder, you have to manage your investors.  You shouldn\\'t\\nignore them, because they may have useful insights.  But neither\\nshould you let them run the company.  That\\'s supposed to be your\\njob.  If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies\\nthey fund, why didn\\'t they start them?Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous\\nthan caving in to them.  In our startup, we erred on the ignoring\\nside.  A lot of our energy got drained\\naway in disputes with investors instead of going into the product.\\nBut this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have\\ndestroyed the company.  If the founders know what they\\'re doing,\\nit\\'s better to have half their attention focused on the product\\nthan the full attention of investors who don\\'t.How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on\\nhow much money you\\'ve taken.  When you raise VC-scale money, the\\ninvestors get a great deal of control.  If they have a board majority,\\nthey\\'re literally your bosses.  In the more common case, where\\nfounders and investors are equally represented and the deciding\\nvote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have\\nto do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.If things go well, this shouldn\\'t matter.  So long as you seem to\\nbe advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.  But\\nthings don\\'t always go smoothly in startups.  Investors have made\\ntrouble even for the most successful companies.  One of the most\\nfamous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder\\nin firing Steve Jobs.  Apparently even Google got a lot of grief\\nfrom their investors early on.15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) ProfitWhen I said at the beginning that if you make something users want,\\nyou\\'ll be fine, you may have noticed I didn\\'t mention anything about\\nhaving the right business model.  That\\'s not because making money\\nis unimportant.  I\\'m not suggesting that founders start companies\\nwith no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before\\nthey tank.  The reason we tell founders not to worry about the\\nbusiness model initially is that making something people want is\\nso much harder.I don\\'t know why it\\'s so hard to make something people want.  It\\nseems like it should be straightforward.  But you can tell it must\\nbe hard by how few startups do it.Because making something people want is so much harder than making\\nmoney from it, you should leave business models for later, just as\\nyou\\'d leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.  In version\\n1, solve the core problem.  And the core problem in a startup is\\nhow to create wealth \\n(= how much people want something x the number\\nwho want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.The companies that win are the ones that put users first.  Google,\\nfor example.  They made search work, then worried about how to make\\nmoney from it.  And yet some startup founders still think it\\'s\\nirresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning.\\nThey\\'re often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes\\nfrom less malleable industries.It is irresponsible not to think about business models.  It\\'s\\njust ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands DirtyNearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code\\nand have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money\\nfrom it.  And not just the lazy ones.  Larry and Sergey apparently\\nfelt this way too at first.  After developing their new search\\nalgorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company\\nto buy it.Start a company?  Yech.  Most hackers would rather just have ideas.\\nBut as Larry and Sergey found, there\\'s not much of a market for\\nideas.  No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and\\nuse that to grow a user base.  Then they\\'ll pay big time.Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.  There\\'s\\nnothing like users for convincing acquirers.  It\\'s not just that\\nthe risk is decreased.  The acquirers are human, and they have a\\nhard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for\\nbeing clever.  When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot\\nof users, they can tell themselves they\\'re buying the users rather\\nthan the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow.\\n[9]If you\\'re going to attract users, you\\'ll probably have to get up\\nfrom your computer and go find some.  It\\'s unpleasant work, but if\\nyou can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of\\nsucceeding.  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer\\nof 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their\\napplications.  But there was one who was away half the time talking\\nto executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals.\\nCan you imagine anything more painful for a hacker?\\n[10]\\nBut it\\npaid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that\\ngroup by an order of magnitude.If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you\\ncan\\'t just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some of\\nthe time doing business stuff.17. Fights Between FoundersFights between founders are surprisingly common.  About 20% of the\\nstartups we\\'ve funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often\\nthat we\\'ve reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don\\'t require\\nit, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly\\nway for people to quit.A founder leaving doesn\\'t necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty\\nof successful startups have had that happen. \\n[11]\\nFortunately it\\'s\\nusually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three\\nfounders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have\\ntwo and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves,\\nthat\\'s more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Blogger\\ngot down to one person, and they bounced back.Most of the disputes I\\'ve seen between founders could have been\\navoided if they\\'d been more careful about who they started a company\\nwith.  Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people.\\nWhich means they\\'re inevitable.  And most founders who\\'ve been\\nburned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed,\\nwhen they started the company.  Don\\'t suppress misgivings.  It\\'s\\nmuch easier to fix problems before the company is started than\\nafter.  So don\\'t include your housemate in your startup because\\nhe\\'d feel left out otherwise.  Don\\'t start a company with someone\\nyou dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you\\nwon\\'t find anyone else.  The people are the most important ingredient\\nin a startup, so don\\'t compromise there.18. A Half-Hearted EffortThe failed startups you hear most about are the spectacular\\nflameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The most\\ncommon type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the\\none that doesn\\'t do much of anything — the one we never even hear\\nabout, because it was some project a couple guys started on the\\nside while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere\\nand was gradually abandoned.Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the\\nmost important thing is to quit your day job.  Most founders of\\nfailed startups don\\'t quit their day jobs, and most founders of\\nsuccessful ones do.  If startup failure were a disease, the CDC\\nwould be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.Does that mean you should quit your day job?  Not necessarily.  I\\'m\\nguessing here, but I\\'d guess that many of these would-be founders\\nmay not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company,\\nand that in the back of their minds, they know it.  The reason they\\ndon\\'t invest more time in their startup is that they know it\\'s a\\nbad investment.\\n[12]I\\'d also guess there\\'s some band of people who could have succeeded\\nif they\\'d taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn\\'t. I have\\nno idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless\\nprogression has the sort of distribution you\\'d expect, the number\\nof people who could have made it, if they\\'d quit their day job, is\\nprobably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make\\nit.\\n[13]If that\\'s true, most startups that could succeed fail because the\\nfounders don\\'t devote their whole efforts to them.  That certainly\\naccords with what I see out in the world.  Most startups fail because\\nthey don\\'t make something people want, and the reason most don\\'t\\nis that they don\\'t try hard enough.In other words, starting startups is just like everything else.\\nThe biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.  To the\\nextent there\\'s a secret to success, it\\'s not to be in denial about\\nthat.\\nNotes[1]\\nThis is not a complete list of the causes of failure,\\njust those you can control.  There are also several you can\\'t,\\nnotably ineptitude and bad luck.[2]\\nIronically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a\\nfacebook exclusively for college students.[3]\\nSteve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying \"Real artists\\nship.\"  This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true.  Many\\nfamous works of art are unfinished.  It\\'s true in fields that have\\nhard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there\\npeople tend to be tweaking stuff till it\\'s yanked out of their\\nhands.[4]\\nThere\\'s probably also a second factor: startup founders tend\\nto be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are\\nprobably especially valuable.[5]\\nYou should take more than you think you\\'ll need, maybe 50% to\\n100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer\\nto close than you expect.[6]\\nSince people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we\\'re\\nnot.  VCs invest large amounts of other people\\'s money.  We invest\\nsmall amounts of our own, like angel investors.[7]\\nNot linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five\\nmillion dollars.  In practice it just feels like it takes forever.Though if you include the cases where VCs don\\'t invest, it would\\nliterally take forever in the median case.  And maybe we should,\\nbecause the danger of chasing large investments is not just that\\nthey take a long time.  That\\'s the best case.  The real danger\\nis that you\\'ll expend a lot of time and get nothing.[8]\\nSome VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see\\nif you have the balls to ask for more.  It\\'s lame that VCs play\\nsuch games, but some do.  If you\\'re dealing with one of those you\\nshould push back on the valuation a bit.[9]\\nSuppose YouTube\\'s founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told\\nthem \"Google Video is badly designed.  Give us $10 million and we\\'ll\\ntell you all the mistakes you made.\"  They would have gotten\\nthe royal raspberry.  Eighteen months later Google paid $1.6 billion\\nfor the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves\\nthat they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague\\nthing like that.I don\\'t mean to be hard on Google.  They did better than their\\ncompetitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.[10]\\nYes, actually: dealing with the government.  But phone companies\\nare up there.[11]\\nMany more than most people realize, because companies don\\'t advertise\\nthis.  Did you know Apple originally had three founders?[12]\\nI\\'m not dissing these people.  I don\\'t have the determination\\nmyself.  I\\'ve twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb,\\nand both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur\\nof poverty I just wasn\\'t willing to endure the stress of a startup.[13]\\nSo how do you know whether you\\'re in the category of people\\nwho should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who\\nshouldn\\'t?  I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge\\nfor yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing\\nthat that\\'s what we do.  We think of ourselves as investors, but\\nviewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for\\nadvising people whether or not to quit their day job.  We could be\\nmistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on\\nour conclusions.Thanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Greg McAdoo, and Robert Morris \\nfor reading drafts of this.\\nJapanese TranslationSpanish TranslationRomanian TranslationChinese TranslationArabic Translation\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Get funded by\\nY Combinator.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOctober 2010\\n\\n(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something\\nabout the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut\\nthe last item because they didn\\'t have room.)1. DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup\\nfounders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most\\nimportant quality would be intelligence.  That\\'s the myth in the\\nValley. And certainly you don\\'t want founders to be stupid.  But\\nas long as you\\'re over a certain threshold of intelligence, what\\nmatters most is determination.  You\\'re going to hit a lot of\\nobstacles.  You can\\'t be the sort of person who gets demoralized\\neasily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay \\nare a good example.  They\\'re\\ndoing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,\\nbureaucratic companies.  When you\\'re starting a startup that depends\\non deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they\\'re\\ntrying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts\\ncalling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not\\ngoing away.\\n2. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases\\nlike \"don\\'t give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so\\nunpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the\\nfly.  The best metaphor I\\'ve found for the combination of determination\\nand flexibility you need is a running back.  \\nHe\\'s determined to get\\ndownfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or\\neven backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of\\nGreplin.  He applied to YC with \\nsome bad ecommerce idea.  We told\\nhim we\\'d fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,\\nand said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling\\non Greplin.  He\\'d only been working on it for a couple days when\\nhe presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.\\nHe always seems to land on his feet.\\n3. ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type\\nthat matters most is imagination.  It\\'s not so important to be able\\nto solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with\\nsurprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas \\nseem\\nbad initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already\\nbe doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces\\nideas with just the right level of craziness.Airbnb is that kind of idea.  \\nIn fact, when we funded Airbnb, we\\nthought it was too crazy.  We couldn\\'t believe large numbers of\\npeople would want to stay in other people\\'s places.  We funded them\\nbecause we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they\\'d\\nbeen supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded\\nbreakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on\\nthe right side of crazy after all.\\n4. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, they\\ntend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They\\'re not Goody\\nTwo-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big\\nquestions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That\\'s why\\nI\\'d use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in \\nbreaking\\nrules, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant\\nthough; it may be implied by imagination.Sam Altman of Loopt \\nis one of the most successful alumni, so we\\nasked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application\\nthat would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask\\nabout a time when they\\'d hacked something to their advantage—hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into\\ncomputers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention\\nto when judging applications.\\n5. FriendshipEmpirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just \\none\\nfounder.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the\\nrelationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must\\ngenuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do\\nto the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:\\nif it can be pulled apart, it will be.Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of Justin.tv \\nare a good example of close\\nfriends who work well together.  They\\'ve known each other since\\nsecond grade.  They can practically read one another\\'s minds.  I\\'m\\nsure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed\\nany unresolved tension between them.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n')]"
